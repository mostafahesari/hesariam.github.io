# Zen of Python is very important set of rules.

It is important to feel you are in the middle of a war ( you are actualy in a warroom) and you are in charge of you peaples life ( the server that you have root access to).
- Think 
	What will happen next and get prepared for ir?.
	How can we help?
	Intract with others only if it is important but do it if it is.
	Do not rush into any thing.Check every simple thing.
	Forget about automation ideas in the middle of change. (write them down)
	Follow the instruction in document and update it.
	Better to have a check list for standard change.
	Do not answer any ones call. You need your focus.
	Drink(water), pee , breath, smoke, but do not flirt or chat with anyone else.
	...
	To be continued.
